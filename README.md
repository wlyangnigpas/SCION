SCION (Spatial Continuous IntegratiON) is a global climate-biogeochemical model that runs over geological timescales. It is a mixed dimensional system with a steady state 3D interpolated climate, 2D land surface and nondimensional ocean. It runs forwards in time and computes the Earthâ€™s major elemental cycles and surface climate. It also predicts the values of a suite of geochemical tracers to aid in hypothesis testing.

### Requies MATLAB. 

For more information on model derivation and running the model, see the Guidebook in the documentation folder.

This code is free to use. The model is under continual revision/extension by my research group and collaborators. For any queries or collaboration ideas please email b.mills@leeds.ac.uk
